## Dataset

**Source:** [`Customer Analytics – E-Commerce Shipping Data (Kaggle)`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics)

*Download and place `Train.csv` in your working directory to run the notebook.*

***

## Project Workflow

- **Data Loading & Understanding**
  - Import and explore e-commerce shipment records
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Visualize shipment trends, time-series, and customer behavior
  - Analyze missing values, outliers, and categorical features

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Derive new features (e.g., delivery duration, city tiers)
  - Encode variables and standardize inputs

- **Predictive Modeling**
  - Model setup for classification or regression (e.g., late/on-time delivery)
  - Train-test split, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation with accuracy/F1

- **Results & Visualizations**
  - Feature importance plots
  - Shipping optimization visual insights

***

## Installation & Usage

**Requirements**

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

**Steps**

1. Clone/download this repository.
2. Download dataset from Kaggle and add to project folder.
3. Run `jupyter_notebook.ipynb` cell-by-cell for the full workflow.
4. Tweak, visualize, and analyze as needed!
